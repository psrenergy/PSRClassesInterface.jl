# SQLite 101

SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system. The lite in SQLite means light weight in terms of setup, database administration, and required resource. SQLite does NOT require a server to run.

Although PSRI provides a simplified interface, similar to `PSRI.OpenStudy`, to read and write data in SQLite format, it is important to understand the basics of SQLite.

To learn the basics, we recommend the following resources:
- [SQLite Tutorial](https://www.sqlitetutorial.net/)
- [SQLite Documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/docs.html)

!!! tip
    We recommend using SQLiteStudio to debug and visualize your SQLite database. You can download it [here](https://sqlitestudio.pl/).
